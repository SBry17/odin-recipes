        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fluffy and moist, blueberry muffins are an excellent addition to any breakfast table.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> white sugar</li>
            <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> baking powder</li>
            <li><strong>1/3 cup</strong> vegetable oil</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> large egg</li>
            <li><strong>1/3 cup</strong> milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries.</li>
            <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
