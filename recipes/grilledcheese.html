        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A grilled cheese sandwhich is the perfect quick meal, but it doesn't have to taste lazy.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sliced Bread</strong> - should be a fluffy, but not too holey. Sourdough or peasant loafs work well.</li>
            <li><strong>Freshly Grated Cheese</strong> - mozerella for texture, and something more flavorful for taste, such as cheddar or gruyere.</li>
            <li><strong>Salted Butter</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grate the cheese.</li>
            <li>Butter both side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Place the bread in a pre-heated skillet to toast it before adding the cheese.</li>
            <li>Turn the bread over, toasted side up, and add the cheese. Take a second piece of break and place it on top, toasted side against the cheese.</li>
            <li>Press down lightly and cook for 3 minutes while the cheese melts.</li>
            <li>Turn the whole sandwhich over and cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the pan. Serve. And enjoy!</li>
